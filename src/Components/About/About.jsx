          Hello! I'm a Front-End Developer passionate about creating user-friendly interfaces and websites.
        </h1>
        <p className="text-justify">
          I’ve always been passionate about design and technology, and I wrote my first lines of code during my university days, where I majored in Management Information Systems. My fascination with creating user-friendly interfaces grew when I worked on my first website, combining aesthetics with functionality to bring ideas to life.
        </p>
        <p className="text-justify">
          As a child, I loved solving puzzles and tinkering with anything I could get my hands on. This curiosity fueled my drive to learn about UI/UX design and front-end development, and I’ve never looked back.
        </p>
        <p className="text-justify">
          One of my proudest moments was during my graduation project, where I designed and developed the front-end of an application that made a real difference for users. That experience taught me the power of combining clean code with thoughtful design.
        </p>
        <p className="text-justify">
          Today, I specialize in building responsive, interactive websites and applications using technologies like React.js, Bootstrap, and Sass. Whether it’s crafting a seamless e-commerce experience or creating a visually striking portfolio, I thrive on transforming ideas into reality.
